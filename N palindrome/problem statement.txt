Let's say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i â‰¤ j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.

Given an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the sought number of pairs that denote palindrome.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a string S, consisting of lowecase Latin letters, and having exactly N distinct palindrome-denoting pairs. If there's a few such strings, output any one.

If such string S doesn't exist, output -1 instead of it.

Example
Input:
3
6
7
2

Output:
noon
radar
ab
